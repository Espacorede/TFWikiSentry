# TF Wiki Sentry

## About

Trying to make contributing to the Team Fortress Wiki a little better.

## Installing

### Firefox

TF Wiki Sentry is available to download and install from the Firefox Add-ons site: [TFWikiSentry](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/tfwikisentry/).

### Google Chrome

To enable this extension on Google Chrome, you will need to visit `chrome://extensions/`, activate "Developer mode", select "Load unpacked" and point to the cloned/downloaded repository.

Just be aware that Google Chrome will keep bugging you because you enabled Developer mode. It's really annoying, so please download a different browser.

### Other Chromium-based browsers

While not tested, this extension should also work with other Chromium-based browsers with little to no tweaks.
